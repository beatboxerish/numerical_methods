### Numerical Methods

This is a small project of mine that I wanted to upload to Pypi.

**Goal :** Create all algorithms from my Numerical Methods generic elective 
course using numpy. Upload this as a package to Pypi. 

You can found the following algorithms: 

1. Gauss Elimination (solve_equations)
